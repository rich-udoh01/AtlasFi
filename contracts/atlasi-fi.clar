;; Title: AtlasFi Protocol - Bitcoin Collateralized Credit Engine
;;
;; Summary:
;; AtlasFi is a next-generation decentralized credit infrastructure built for Bitcoin holders.
;; It provides a capital-efficient mechanism to unlock liquidity against BTC while embedding
;; institutional-grade risk controls. The protocol is designed for sustainable growth, ensuring
;; users retain Bitcoin exposure while accessing stable, predictable on-chain loans.
;;
;; Description:
;; AtlasFi transforms passive Bitcoin positions into productive assets within the DeFi ecosystem.
;; By offering dynamic collateralization management, automated liquidation safeguards, and
;; real-time asset pricing, the protocol guarantees solvency without compromising capital efficiency.
;;
;; Key Features:
;;   - Bitcoin-backed credit lines secured by configurable collateralization ratios
;;   - Automated liquidation protection to reduce systemic risk
;;   - Flexible and upgradable interest rate framework
;;   - Oracle-driven real-time asset price integration
;;   - Governance-enabled parameter tuning for evolving market conditions
;;   - Multi-asset infrastructure for future extensibility
